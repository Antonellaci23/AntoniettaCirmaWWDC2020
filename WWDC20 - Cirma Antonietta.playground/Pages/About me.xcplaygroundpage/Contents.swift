# About me
 I'm Cirma Antonietta, I am from a small Italian city, Teano and i'm 28 years old.
 I have a master's degree in Structural and Geotechnical Engineering, which I pursued at the “Federico II Univesity” of Naples.
 
 Last September I decided to participate in the selections to being part of the Apple Developer Academy in Naples, despite it being a different path from mine. My idea was to obtain transversal technical skills so that I could apply the world of development to the world of Civil Engineering.
 
 At first, I was very hesitant, because, having a background in structural and geotechnical engineering, I saw the Academy as something that could never belong to me and too far from what I have always done and studied.
 
 Despite this, I decided to try out of curiosity and immediately noticed that, not only I was able to learn, but also I really liked what I was learning: I was completely captured.
 
 Every day I learned more and more, from the most technical things to knowing how to be in a group where everyone had their own ideas, their knowledges and mixing everything because I understood that diversity is the strength of each group.
 
 I found this experience extremely formative, both from a technical point of view, managing to increase my knowledge and my background, and from the point of view of personal growth, having more awareness of myself.
